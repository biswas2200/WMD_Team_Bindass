Eligibility and Participation
Age Requirement
Participants must be 16 years of age or older.

Registration
Only individuals who complete the official registration form will be granted access to the hackathon platform.

Online Participation
The hackathon is fully online. All team activities, including collaboration, workshops, mentoring, and project submissions, must take place using the designated platforms.

Team Composition
Teams may consist of 1 to 4 members. All members must be officially registered. Collaboration outside official channels is allowed only for coordination among registered teammates.

Project Rules
Use of Sponsor Technology
To qualify for cash prizes or interview opportunities, projects must follow the requirements for each prize category. Each award is tied to specific sponsor tools, and your submission must meet those requirements to be eligible.

The Infinity Build Award – $5,000
Your project must use Cline CLI. Cline must be used to build capabilities on top of the CLI that improve the software development experience, and your project should demonstrate complete, working automation tools built through the CLI.
The Wakanda Data Award – $4,000
Your project must use Kestra's built-in AI Agent to summarise data from other systems, with bonus credit if your agent can make decisions based on the summarised data.
The Iron Intelligence Award – $3,000
Your project must use the Oumi open-source library and must include Oumi's Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning features as part of your submission. Data Synthesis and LLM-as-a-Judge are optional but encouraged.
The Stormbreaker Deployment Award – $2,000
Your project must be deployed on Vercel, and the deployment must be live. Any standard Vercel deployment qualifies.
The Captain Code Award – $1,000
Your repository must demonstrate the use of CodeRabbit for PR reviews, code quality improvements, documentation, and open-source best practices. CodeRabbit activity should be clearly visible.
Projects that do not use the required sponsor technologies for their respective categories are not eligible for those sponsor-specific prizes.
Refer to the Resources section for guides and documentation.

What to Use for Each Sponsor
Make sure to check out the resources section to learn more about these tools.

Cline
Participants must use the Cline CLI, the command-line interface for autonomous AI coding agents. You should build new capabilities on top of the CLI that improve the software development experience, and your project should demonstrate complete, working automation tools built through the CLI.

Kestra
Your project must use Kestra's built-in AI Agent to summarise data from other systems, with bonus consideration if the agent can also make decisions based on the summarised data.

Oumi
Your submission must use the Oumi open-source library, specifically Oumi's Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning features (more info). You may also choose to use Data Synthesis, LLM-as-a-Judge, or any examples provided in the Oumi notebooks, as these are optional but encouraged.

Vercel
Your project must be deployed on Vercel. Any standard Vercel deployment qualifies.

CodeRabbit
Your repository should demonstrate the use of CodeRabbit for PR reviews, code quality suggestions, documentation improvements, and overall open-source best practices. CodeRabbit activity should be clearly visible in your workflow.

Creation Guidelines
All work (code, design, hardware) must be created during the hackathon.
Open-source libraries, APIs, Creative Commons media, and publicly available resources may be used.
Pre-event planning such as sketches, ideas, or documentation is allowed.
Use of AI tools is permitted.
Projects must include meaningful software development. Hardware components are optional.
Intellectual Property
WeMakeDevs does not claim ownership of hackathon ideas or projects.
This hackathon is an experiential learning event, and most ideas will be early stage.
If a project is based on a pre-existing or more developed idea, ownership remains with the originator and any team members who significantly contribute.
Teams must resolve ownership and contribution arrangements internally.
Code of Conduct
Treat all participants, mentors, and organizers with respect.
Harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior will not be tolerated.
Collaboration is encouraged, but plagiarism or misrepresentation of work will lead to disqualification.
Participants must follow the rules of all hackathon platforms and respect community guidelines.
Submission Guidelines
Each submission must include:

GitHub Repository
A public repo with visible commit history.

README File
A clear explanation of the project, setup instructions, and usage details.

Demo Video
A mandatory 2-minute demo showcasing the project.

Deployment
Optional for most tracks but earns extra credit.
Deployment is mandatory when competing for prizes that require Vercel.
